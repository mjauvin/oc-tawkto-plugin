# TawkTo Chat Plugin

## Chat Component

### The chat component can be included on any page/layout by itself

The following plugin global settings can be set for the chat:

- Chat activation switch
- Chat Site ID
- Chat Widget Name

From within the component inspector, global settings can be overriden by assigning values to the following properties:

- Chat Site ID (defaults to the global setting)
- Chat Widget Name (defaults to the global setting)

This allows installing more than one instance of the chat on a page, or install a different chat widget on another page.
